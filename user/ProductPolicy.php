    <h1>Product Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At GOGO_Supermarket, we are committed to offering only high-quality, reliable, and safe products that meet the expectations and needs of our valued customers. This Product Policy outlines our principles and practices concerning the selection, presentation, and management of all products available on our platform.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Product Sourcing</h2>
    <p>
      All products sold on GOGO_Supermarket are sourced from trusted suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. We conduct thorough due diligence and quality assessments before onboarding any new vendor or product category. Our sourcing decisions are based on:

        <li>Product authenticity and certification</li>
        <li>Manufacturer credibility and compliance history</li>
        <li>Adherence to local and international safety standards</li>
        <li>Environmental and ethical practices</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Product Authenticity</h2>
    <p>
      We guarantee that all branded products on our website are 100% genuine. We do not support counterfeit, imitation, or replica goods. Customers can shop with confidence, knowing that their purchases are authentic and backed by appropriate warranties when applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Product Information and Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      We strive to present accurate and up-to-date product information, including:

      However, in some cases, discrepancies may arise due to supplier updates or system delays. If you find any errors, please notify us, and we will correct them as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Product Availability</h2>
    <p>
      Product availability is subject to stock levels and supplier inventories. While we make every effort to ensure continuous availability, we reserve the right to discontinue or limit quantities without prior notice. If a product becomes unavailable after you place an order, our support team will offer alternative solutions or issue a refund.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Product Pricing</h2>
    <p>
      All prices displayed on our website are in Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) and include applicable taxes unless otherwise stated. We reserve the right to adjust product prices in response to market trends, supplier costs, or promotional activities. Pricing errors, if discovered, may lead to cancellation or correction of affected orders.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Safety and Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize your safety by ensuring that all products meet required safety and regulatory standards. For example:

        <li>Children's toys meet age-appropriate safety labeling requirements</li>
        <li>Cosmetics are registered and approved under appropriate safety frameworks</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>7. Packaging Standards</h2>
    <p>
      We take great care in packaging our products to ensure they arrive in excellent condition. Our packaging process includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Bubble wrapping or cushioning for fragile items</li>
        <li>Sealed packaging for consumables</li>
        <li>Tamper-proof seals on sensitive goods</li>
        <li>Eco-friendly packaging wherever possible</li>
      </ul>
      In the event of damage during transit, customers are encouraged to report issues immediately with photographic evidence.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Product Reviews and Ratings</h2>
    <p>
      GOGO_Supermarket encourages genuine product reviews from customers to help others make informed decisions. We monitor all submitted reviews to ensure authenticity, relevance, and compliance with our content guidelines. Fake or misleading reviews may be removed without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Promotions and Bundled Products</h2>
    <p>
      Occasionally, we may offer bundled deals, combo packs, or promotional gifts. These are subject to availability and may be withdrawn or replaced at our discretion. Promotional items are not eligible for individual returns unless defective.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Product Recalls</h2>
    <p>
      In the rare event of a product recall due to safety or regulatory concerns, we will notify affected customers immediately through email, SMS, or account alerts. Instructions for returning the product and receiving a replacement or refund will be provided.
