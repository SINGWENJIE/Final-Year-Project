    <h1>Halal Assurance Statement</h1>
    <p>
      GOGO_Supermarket is deeply committed to serving our Muslim customers by offering products that align with halal standards as outlined by recognized Islamic authorities. This Halal Statement explains our sourcing practices, certification process, handling methods, and our promise to uphold the integrity of halal products throughout the supply chain.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Halal</h2>
    <p>
      Halal is more than a label — it is a principle rooted in purity, transparency, and ethical conduct. GOGO_Supermarket recognizes its importance to Muslim consumers and ensures that all products marketed or labeled as "halal" are sourced, stored, and delivered in accordance with Shariah principles.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Halal-Certified Products</h2>
    <p>
      All food and beverage items that are sold under the “Halal” category on our website are:
      <ul>
        <li>Procured only from suppliers and manufacturers who possess valid and current halal certification</li>
        <li>Certified by authorized Islamic bodies, including <strong>JAKIM (Department of Islamic Development Malaysia)</strong> or other recognized international halal certification organizations</li>
        <li>Accompanied by documentation verifying their halal status</li>
      </ul>
      We regularly audit our suppliers to ensure ongoing compliance with halal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Categories Covered</h2>
    <p>
      Halal compliance applies to various product categories such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Fresh and frozen meats</li>
        <li>Processed foods and snacks</li>
        <li>Dairy products</li>
        <li>Health supplements</li>
        <li>Cosmetics and personal care items (when labeled halal)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cross-Contamination Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      To preserve halal integrity, we implement strict storage, handling, and packaging protocols:
      <ul>
        <li>Separate storage areas for halal and non-halal goods in our warehouses</li>
        <li>Dedicated delivery arrangements for bulk halal shipments (where required)</li>
        <li>Clear labeling and segregation on our online platform</li>
      </ul>
      All employees involved in product handling are trained on halal awareness and contamination prevention.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Alcohol and Non-Halal Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      Products that contain alcohol, gelatin derived from non-halal sources, or any ingredient considered haram (forbidden) under Islamic law will not be classified or promoted as halal. Our team thoroughly reviews ingredient lists and supplier documentation before approving items as halal.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Halal Logos and Labelling</h2>
    <p>
      Only products with valid halal certification are permitted to display halal logos on their packaging or product listings. We do not tolerate misleading halal claims, and any product found to carry a fraudulent label will be removed immediately, with action taken against the supplier.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Imported Halal Products</h2>
    <p>
      Imported products marketed as halal must:
      <ul>
        <li>Be certified by a halal body recognized by JAKIM (such as MUIS in Singapore, MUI in Indonesia, etc.)</li>
        <li>Be accompanied by proof of halal certification and product origin</li>
        <li>Follow similar cross-contamination prevention protocols during shipping and storage</li>
      </ul>
      GOGO_Supermarket maintains a list of accepted foreign halal certification bodies for internal verification.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Customer Assurance & Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      We understand that trust is earned through transparency. Customers are encouraged to:
      <ul>
        <li>Contact us if they need certification documents or clarification on specific products</li>
        <li>Review the halal certificate numbers shown on product listings (when available)</li>
        <li>Report any suspicious or unclear halal labeling</li>
      </ul>
      Our customer service team will respond promptly and assist with your inquiries.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Continuous Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      We are constantly improving our halal sourcing and verification processes. GOGO_Supermarket is exploring long-term partnerships with certified halal logistics providers, and we aim to increase the availability of halal-friendly categories, such as household and skincare items.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      While we make every effort to ensure accuracy and compliance, GOGO_Supermarket cannot be held liable for any certification errors or mislabeling by third-party suppliers. However, we will take immediate corrective action, including refunds or replacements, in the event of proven non-compliance.
