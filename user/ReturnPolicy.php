    <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At GOGO_Supermarket, we aim to provide you with the best shopping experience possible. However, we understand that there may be occasions where you need to return a product. This Return and Refund Policy outlines the procedures, conditions, and timeframes for returning products and obtaining refunds or exchanges.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Return Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Products may be eligible for return under the following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>The item is defective, damaged, or malfunctioning upon delivery</li>
        <li>The product received is incorrect (wrong size, color, or model)</li>
        <li>The item is incomplete (missing parts or accessories)</li>
        <li>You have received an expired product (for consumables)</li>
      </ul>
      Items must be returned in their original packaging with all accompanying documentation, tags, manuals, and accessories intact.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Non-Returnable Items</h2>
    <p>
      Certain categories of products are not eligible for return due to hygiene, safety, or perishable nature. These include but are not limited to:
      <ul>
        <li>Perishable food and beverage items</li>
        <li>Health and personal care products (unless damaged or expired)</li>
        <li>Underwear, lingerie, and swimwear</li>
        <li>Digital goods, software, and gift cards</li>
        <li>Customized or made-to-order products</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. Timeframe for Returns</h2>
    <p>
      To be eligible for a return or exchange, you must notify us within <strong>7 calendar days</strong> of receiving the product. Requests made beyond this window may not be entertained unless covered under a warranty claim.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Return Process</h2>
    <p>
      To initiate a return:
      <ol>
        <li>Log in to your GOGO account and go to the "My Orders" section</li>
        <li>Select the item you wish to return and click on "Request Return"</li>
        <li>Provide a clear reason for the return, along with supporting photos if applicable</li>
        <li>Our customer service team will respond within 2–3 business days with further instructions</li>
        <li>Once approved, pack the item securely and send it to the provided return address</li>
      </ol>
      Please retain your shipping receipt and tracking number until the return is confirmed.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Refunds will be processed once we receive and inspect the returned product. Depending on your payment method, refunds may take up to:
      <ul>
        <li>5–7 business days for online banking or credit card payments</li>
        <li>2–3 business days for e-wallet transactions</li>
      </ul>
      Refunds will be made to the original payment method used during checkout.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Exchange Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If you prefer an exchange rather than a refund, please indicate your preference during the return request. Exchanges are subject to stock availability. If the requested item is no longer available, we will proceed with a refund instead.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Return Shipping Costs</h2>
    <p>
      Return shipping costs are covered by GOGO_Supermarket in the following cases:
      <ul>
        <li>Wrong item delivered</li>
        <li>Defective or damaged product</li>
        <li>Incomplete product or missing accessories</li>
      </ul>
      For returns due to a change of mind, incorrect purchase, or non-defective issues, the customer will bear the return shipping costs.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Conditions for Rejection</h2>
    <p>
      GOGO_Supermarket reserves the right to reject any return if:
      <ul>
        <li>The item has been used or shows signs of wear and tear</li>
        <li>The product is returned without original packaging and accessories</li>
        <li>The item was purchased under a "Clearance" or "Final Sale" label</li>
        <li>The product is damaged due to improper handling or installation by the customer</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Return Status Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Once your return request is approved and your package has been shipped, you may track the return status in your GOGO account under "Return History." You will also receive email notifications regarding each update.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Warranty Claims</h2>
    <p>
      Some products may be covered by a manufacturer’s warranty. If your item qualifies, please follow the warranty claim instructions included with the product. Warranty processing times may vary depending on the brand or service center involved.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Abuse of Return Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We monitor return activities for abuse. Excessive or unreasonable returns, especially those not aligned with the policy, may result in:
      <ul>
        <li>Temporary or permanent suspension of return privileges</li>
        <li>Account review or deactivation</li>
        <li>Legal action in the event of fraud or misrepresentation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>12. Policy Updates</h2>
