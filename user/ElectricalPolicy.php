    <h1>Electrical and Electronic Safety Policy</h1>
    <p>
      GOGO_Supermarket is committed to ensuring that all electrical and electronic products sold through our platform meet strict safety, environmental, and regulatory standards. This Electrical Policy outlines our quality expectations, safety practices, compliance requirements, and customer responsibilities regarding the use and disposal of electrical items.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope of the Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to:
      <ul>
        <li>All electrical and electronic items listed on GOGO_Supermarket’s online platform</li>
        <li>Suppliers and vendors providing such products</li>
        <li>Customers purchasing and using electrical products</li>
      </ul>
      It covers safety standards, product certification, energy efficiency, and disposal practices in accordance with Malaysian laws and international standards.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Product Safety Standards</h2>
    <p>
      All electrical and electronic products sold on our platform must:
      <ul>
        <li>Comply with the <strong>Electrical Supply Act 1990 (Malaysia)</strong> and related safety regulations</li>
        <li>Be certified by recognized regulatory bodies such as SIRIM or equivalent</li>
        <li>Carry clear labeling for voltage, wattage, and usage instructions</li>
        <li>Be accompanied by proper manuals and safety warnings (in Bahasa Malaysia or English)</li>
      </ul>
      We reserve the right to delist any product found to be non-compliant or hazardous.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Supplier Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      All suppliers and vendors of electrical goods must:
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure their products are tested and certified according to Malaysian standards</li>
        <li>Provide proof of compliance documentation upon request</li>
        <li>Cooperate with GOGO_Supermarket for audits, reviews, and quality checks</li>
        <li>Promptly report any known defects or recalls</li>
      </ul>
      Non-compliance may result in suspension of the vendor's account or legal action.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      Customers are expected to:
      <ul>
        <li>Use products according to manufacturer instructions</li>
        <li>Ensure the proper voltage is used for all electrical items</li>
        <li>Keep products away from water or hazardous environments unless certified as waterproof</li>
        <li>Inspect products upon delivery and report any visible damage before usage</li>
      </ul>
      GOGO_Supermarket is not liable for damages resulting from misuse or unsafe handling of electrical products.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Installation and Repairs</h2>
    <p>
      For products requiring installation (e.g., air conditioners, ovens), we highly recommend that only certified technicians carry out the work. Unauthorized installation may:
      <ul>
        <li>Void your warranty</li>
        <li>Pose safety hazards</li>
        <li>Lead to product malfunction or damage</li>
      </ul>
      GOGO_Supermarket is not responsible for issues arising from third-party installations or repairs.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>
      We encourage customers to purchase energy-efficient products certified with energy labels. Energy-efficient items:
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce electricity bills</li>
        <li>Have a lower environmental footprint</li>
        <li>Meet the minimum energy performance standards (MEPS)</li>
      </ul>
      GOGO_Supermarket is actively working to expand our catalog of eco-friendly electronics.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Electrical Product Disposal</h2>
    <p>
      Improper disposal of electronic waste can be harmful to the environment. We advise customers to:
      <ul>
        <li>Follow proper e-waste disposal practices</li>
        <li>Use local e-waste collection services or recycling programs</li>
        <li>Avoid disposing electronics in regular trash bins</li>
      </ul>
      We are exploring partnerships with licensed e-waste collectors to offer a return-and-recycle program in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Warranty and Product Returns</h2>
    <p>
      Most electrical products come with a manufacturer’s warranty. Customers should:
      <ul>
        <li>Retain receipts and warranty cards</li>
        <li>Register products (if applicable) with the brand’s service provider</li>
        <li>Contact support within the warranty period for any issues</li>
      </ul>
      Electrical products returned must be in good condition with original accessories. For detailed info, refer to our Return Policy.
    </p>
